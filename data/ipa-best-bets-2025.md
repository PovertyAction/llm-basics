## Generalizing Evidence on Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES)

### Executive Summary

December 2025

## What is PES?

Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) programs offer financial incentives to landholders who protect natural resources rather than converting land to other uses. PES has the potential to reduce deforestation, protect ecosystems, and provide economic benefits to communities in low- and middle-income countries. However, success depends on local conditions, behavioral responses, and implementation capacity that determine whether outcomes observed in one setting can be replicated elsewhere—especially at scale through government systems.

This synthesis applies the Generalizability Framework to identify which conditions enable PES to work across contexts, drawing on 40+ experimental and quasi-experimental studies and emphasizing large-scale, government-implemented programs.

## Three Key Dimensions for PES Effectiveness

### 1. Local Conditions

#### Opportunity Costs

- **PES works best on land with moderate deforestation risk**—not so low that conservation would happen anyway, nor so high that payments become fiscally prohibitive
- **Successful programs** (Mexico, Costa Rica) anchor payment rates to local agricultural returns (maize income, cattle pasture values) and use simple payment brackets rather than flat rates
- **Payments must cover both opportunity costs** (forgone income) and compliance costs (time, effort, management requirements)

#### Land Tenure Security

- **PES requires clear enough land rights** to enforce contracts, but formal titles are not always necessary
- **De facto rights work** when locally recognized (Uganda, Malawi pilots); communal tenure (Mexico's ejidos, Brazil's use-rights) scales effectively
- **Strict title requirements** (Costa Rica, Ecuador) improve enforceability but exclude poorer households unless paired with titling support
- **Gender-sensitive design is critical**—rules should recognize women's land rights through co-titling and acceptance of use-rights

**Key Trade-offs:** Strict title rules enhance enforcement but reduce inclusion; flexible recognition expands coverage but requires stronger local governance.

### 2. Behavioral Responses

PES effectiveness relies on core behavioral levers that operate consistently across contexts:

#### Core Levers

- **Reciprocity:** Payments viewed as fair exchange sustain conservation legitimacy
- **Loss aversion:** Conditional payments make non-compliance feel costly once participants expect the transfer
- **Monitoring salience:** Visible verification (satellite monitoring, spot checks) increases perceived detection and boosts compliance

#### Design Innovations

- **Timing:** Front-loading payments can ease liquidity constraints and improve compliance by ~10 percentage points (India)
- **Enrollment rules:** Full-plot enrollment prevents strategic selection—Mexico's requirement reduced deforestation by 41% and quadrupled cost-effectiveness
- **Screening mechanisms:** Auctions and scoring rules identify landholders likely to comply at lower cost (Malawi, U.S. CRP)
- **Follow-through:** Incentives must align with final outcomes, not just initial actions (Zambia tree-planting example shows high adoption but low survival)

**Design Guidance:** Pair conditionality with credible monitoring; use enrollment rules that prevent cherry-picking low-risk parcels; consider timing innovations for liquidity-constrained participants; expect trade-offs between efficiency and inclusion.

### 3. Implementation Conditions

Scale with fidelity requires four essential "plumbing" components:

#### A. Land Verification

- **Standard approach:** separate rights layer (ownership proof) from operational layer (contract polygon for payment/monitoring)
- **Reduce participant burden** through intermediaries, NGOs, or student mapping brigades using GPS/mobile tools
- **Strict cadastre requirements not always necessary**—georeferenced polygons linked to recognized rightsholders suffice

#### B. Conditionality & Enforcement

- **Satellite-first monitoring** with targeted ground-truthing is now standard (Mexico, Costa Rica evolved from 50% field verification to satellite-led detection)
- **Countries can build capacity** using free NASA training and open tools (Google Earth Engine, Global Forest Watch, MapBiomas)
- **Political economy is the bottleneck:** ~63% of programs monitor comprehensively, but only ~26% sanction consistently
- **Graduated sanctions** work better in collective settings (warning → partial withholding → termination) than full contract termination

#### C. Payment Systems

- **On-time, transparent payments** build trust and sustain compliance
- **Direct bank transfers or mobile wallets** dominate; sector-managed systems are the norm
- **Modernize** through digital ID, interoperable platforms, and automated disbursement once compliance is verified

#### D. Low Transaction Costs

- **Information costs dominate** early enrollment—budget for outreach and simple messaging
- **Streamline documentation**; if requiring management plans, subsidize technical assistance
- **Every extra step filters out target participants** and biases toward better-off households

**Implementation Guidance:** Make monitoring salient with clear protocols; use satellite + stratified field checks; publish payment calendars and treat on-time delivery as KPI; leverage intermediaries to reduce applicant burden.

## Sustainability & Financing

Long-term success requires stable funding mechanisms:

- **Tax-backed models** (Costa Rica fuel tax) provide the most predictable base but need diversification as tax sources evolve
- **Budget-funded models** (Ecuador, Mexico) scale quickly but are vulnerable to fiscal shocks and political changes
- **Private/user-financed models** work locally (water utilities, tourism, carbon buyers) but main buyers are typically government agencies
- **Blended finance** (emerging innovation) combines public, private, and donor funds to stabilize flows and crowd in investment—promising but not yet at scale for most national PES programs

**Post-payment durability** remains an open question—rigorous evidence on conservation persistence after payments end is limited.

## Key Takeaways

**Where PES Works Best:** Moderate opportunity costs + clear enough tenure + credible monitoring + low transaction costs + stable financing

### Critical Success Factors

- Target the "sweet spot" between low-threat and high-value conversion land
- Use simple payment differentiation (2-5 brackets) anchored to local returns
- Accept flexible tenure arrangements but ensure local recognition and enforcement capacity
- Design enrollment rules that prevent strategic selection of non-threatened parcels
- Invest in satellite monitoring infrastructure with calibrated field verification
- Prioritize payment system reliability—late or uncertain transfers undermine trust
- Minimize paperwork and offer assisted enrollment for inclusivity

**Evidence Gaps:** Post-payment conservation durability; unconditional transfers vs. conditional payments; trust in institutions and cultural norms as drivers of ecological outcomes
